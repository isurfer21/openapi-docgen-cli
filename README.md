```

You can use any combination of above listed **Usages** patterns.

## Use-cases

Below are the various use cases of this app. Just find out the one relevant for you.

### Generate single-file embedded doc with default name 

To generate doc for any `sample.json`, run this command

```shell
oadg sample.json

```

By default, it would generate a `sample.html` file with embedded content. Here, the `.html` name is extracted from the base filename of `sample.json`, i.e., `sample`. 

### Generate single-file embedded doc with custom name

If you specify output name, run this command

```shell
oadg sample.json petstore

```

It would generate a `petstore.html` file with embedded content. Here, the provided custom filename is used for `.html` file.

### Generate isolated files doc

Similarly, to generate isolated content, run this command

```shell
oadg sample.json --isolated
```

It would generate a wrapper file as `sample.html` that loads the `sample.json` file content.

### Generate isolated files doc with custom name

If you specify output name, run this command

```shell
oadg sample.json petstore --isolated

```

It would generate a `petstore.html` file with embedded content. Here, the provided custom filename is used for `.html` & `.json` files.

### Generate isolated files doc with alternative file type

Here, alternative file type could be generated as

```shell
oadg sample.json --isolated --yaml
```

That would generates the `sample.yaml` along with wrapper file `sample.html` which loads the `sample.yaml` file content.

Similarly, you could generate the `sample.json` along with wrapper file `sample.html` via

```shell
oadg sample.yaml --isolated --json
```

### Using in dev-mode for real-time edit & preview

In dev-mode, isolated wrapper `.html` is generated automatically and served via development server on browser. So that you can edit the `.json` or `.yaml` source file and preview it live at serving URL.

```shell
oadg sample.json --dev
```

After beginning the dev server, it would automatically opens the default browser with serving URL. You just need to refresh it everytime after you make any change in the `.json` or `.yaml` source file.

### Running the dev-server at different host/port

To run the dev server at different host or port, run this command

```shell
oadg sample.json --dev --host=localhost --port=8000
```

Here you can specify the custom host address and/or port number where you want the dev server to seve at.
